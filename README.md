## 🌟 About Me

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I am a B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a strong interest in building practical, problem-driven software systems.

My primary focus lies in computer vision, deep learning, and applied machine learning, particularly in projects that address real-world challenges. I have experience working on end-to-end AI applications, including data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and basic deployment.

I have worked on projects involving visual diagnosis of skin diseases using image recognition techniques, where I explored convolutional neural networks, image processing, and severity analysis. Through these projects, I have developed a solid understanding of how theoretical machine learning concepts translate into usable systems.

I enjoy learning by building and iterating on projects rather than limiting myself to purely theoretical knowledge. I am particularly interested in improving model performance, understanding failure cases, and making AI systems more reliable and practical.

I am actively looking to collaborate on meaningful AI/ML projects, research-oriented work, and opportunities that allow me to deepen my understanding of intelligent systems while contributing to impactful solutions.

⚡ Fun fact  
I like building things fast and learning by doing.
